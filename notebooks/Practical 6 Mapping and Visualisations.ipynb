    "# Practical 6: Mapping and visualisations\n",
    "\n",
    "In this practical we will focus on consolidating some of the lessons learned on creating effective maps. In the lecture we discussed some of the important design considerations for making clear, accessible, legible, *honest* maps. Now we implement a few of those technical points. We've already been making quick plots of our geographic data and in the last practical we started to create *choropleth* maps, but we'll look at a few more options for mapping.\n",
    "\n",
    "This practical covers several topics (and a few smaller ones along the way):\n",
    "* Mapping with point-referenced data\n",
    "* Adding in external basemaps or satellite imagery\n",
    "* Creating thematic maps\n",
    "* Adjusting classifications visualising data\n",
    "* Controlling multiple layers and multiple maps\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating static maps in Python with `GeoPandas` relies on `matplotlib` extensively. If you're less familiar with this graphics library, check out some of the tutorials: [https://matplotlib.org/tutorials/index.html](https://matplotlib.org/tutorials/index.html). It's also good to refer back to the documentation occassionally because there are many things you can control/adjust in a plot, and we can't show you everything in this limited practical session.\n",
    "\n",
    "Be sure to read the code blocks and the comments carefully in this practical. There are a lot of parameters and settings. Experiment with changing them and re-mapping your data."
