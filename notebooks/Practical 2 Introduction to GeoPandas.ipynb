    "## Geospatial vector data\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different mathematical data models that can be used to represent objects, surfaces, or other geographic phenomena. These specify how data are defined, organised, updated, and queried. The *vector* data model is one example and, as we discussed in the lecture, it is usually contrasted with the *raster* data model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vector data represent features whose geometry can consist of:\n",
    "* Points - a vertex or position in space with X, Y, and optionally Z coordinates\n",
    "\n",
    "* Lines - sets of vertices linked by paths where the start and ending point are not linked\n",
    "\n",
    "* Polygons - a closed shape formed by a set of vertices and paths in a set order, where the start and ending point are the same\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't confuse the data model with a specific file format. There are now several different file formats that can be used to store geospatial vector data (see also: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIS_file_formats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIS_file_formats)).\n",
    "\n",
    "The *shapefile* is still a well-known and common file format because it is used by a major GIS software company (ESRI). Other common formats you're likely to encounter are: *geopackages* and *GeoJSON* files. You might notice that the files we're using in the `\\data` directory are usually compressed (&ast;.zip). This is mostly for convenience of storing them on Github. Working with your own data you may want to leave them unzipped.\n",
    "\n",
    "Try unzipping one of the shapefiles (&ast;.shp.zip) on your computer. You will see that it isn't just one file, but a collection of several files. These contain either the geometry, the attributes, a spatial index, coordinate information. And you have to keep them all together and named the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you open one of the geopackages (&ast;.gpkg) and inspect it, you will see that inside is actually a SQLite database (which adhere to certain standards: [https://www.geopackage.org/](https://www.geopackage.org/)). There are many ways to work with vector data files, and we're going to focus on using `GeoPandas` within Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless of the file format of the vector data, `fiona` makes it easy to read into GeoPandas using the `geopandas.read_file` command.\n"
