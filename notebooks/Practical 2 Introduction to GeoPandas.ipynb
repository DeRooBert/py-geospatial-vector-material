    "## Geospatial vector data\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different mathematical data models that can be used to represent objects, surfaces, or other geographic phenomena. These specify how data are defined, organised, updated, and queried. The *vector* data model is one example (and as we discussed in the lecture, it is usually contrasted with the *raster* data model).\n",
    "\n",
    "Vector data represent features whose geometry can consist of:\n",
    "* Points - a vertex or position in space with X, Y, and optionally Z coordinates\n",
    "\n",
    "* Lines - sets of vertices linked by paths where the start and ending point are not the same location\n",
    "\n",
    "* Polygons - a closed shape formed by a set of vertices and paths in a set order, where the start and ending point are the same\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't confuse the data model with a specific file format. There are now several different file formats that can be used to store geospatial vector data (see also: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIS_file_formats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIS_file_formats)).\n",
    "\n",
    "The *shapefile* is still a well-known and common file format because it is used by a major GIS software company ESRI). Other common formats you're likely to encounter are: *geopackages* and *GeoJSON* files. You might notice that the files we're using in the `\\data` directory are compressed (&ast;.zip). This is mostly for convenience of storing them on Github. Working with your own data you may want to leave them unzipped.\n",
    "\n",
    "Try unzipping one of the shapefiles (&ast;.shp.zip). You will see that it isn't one file, but a collection of several files. These contain the geometry, the attributes, coordinate information. And you have to keep them all together.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you unzip one of the geopackages (&ast;.gpkg.zip) and inspect it, you will see that inside is actually a SQLite database (which adhere to certain standards: [https://www.geopackage.org/](https://www.geopackage.org/)). There are manay ways to work with vector data files, and we're going to focus just on using `GeoPandas` and Python.\n",
